# Whisper Transcription App Project

Initial project based on the specification in `tasks/init-Project-Spec.md`. 

This project involves creating a lightweight macOS desktop application that provides:
- Simple interface for audio recording
- Transcription using faster-whisper
- Post-processing with fabric
- Integration with Raycast
- Visual feedback during recording

The app needs to deliver a smooth user experience with real-time feedback, proper error handling, and seamless integration with existing workflows.
